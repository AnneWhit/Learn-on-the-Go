# **Setting up VS.Code with Github pages to work offline**

### Open your terminal and go to Desktop.

#### I am working in windows 10 and have Git bash terminal.  Everytime I open gitbash, I need to bring it into windows Desktop. This is how I do that incase you run into the same problem.
```bash
cd c:/
cd User/
cd Anne/
cd Desktop/
```
#### Make sure you run each piece of code seperately. 
```bash
$ls
```
#### Just to make sure in the right place.
