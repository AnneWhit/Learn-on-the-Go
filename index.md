# Learn-on-the-Go


# What I Do When Waiting for a Delivery .
### First thing I do is organize my thoughts and ask myself Questions.

List:
- What do I want to Create ?
- How do | want It to look ?
- What will be The main theme?

### These are some Questions, but the Main thing is to organize all the different thoughts battling my mind.

## To start I will explain: Who am I?
To put it simply. I am a 57 years old, who has four children (all out on their own). My husband passed a few years ago.

Technology has fascinated me for many years. I remember getting my first Color T.V. when I was 8. The lrst cordless phone, beepers and then the first cell phones ( you must be rich to own one of those LOL ). The TRS 80 that Played a Gargoyle game that only played in dos. After I had kids - Dial up Internet was a problem with four kids all wanting to use it with only one desktop computer to share. 
Through the years I have tried to keep up. First learning a little HTML and CSS code to make my own website. Then getting intrigued with python. I wrote my first code in a text editor and then a compilier. Today I see Something interesting and will go learn it. Like this post. I'm using markdown and github for this to learn how to use it.

I am now sitting uptown in my car writing this on my tablet with a Stylis pen in markdown code while waiting for a delivery from either doordash or grubhub. No orders yet, but to be fare, I knew it was too early. If I would have started this at home, I wouldn't have come to work at all today. This is more fun than delivering.

## Organize Thoughts:
List:
- To start setting up github pages.
    - 1.  Create New Repository with name: 'Learn on the Go'
    - 2.   Add this Markdown code to repository,
    (Yay, got an order)
    - 3.  Go to Setting, github pages and set up.
    - 4.  See how it looks-.
